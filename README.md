# 🛠️ Automatic Mapping with TurtleBot4

This repository showcases an innovative project leveraging TurtleBot4 for autonomous mapping. The robot dynamically explores a closed map, navigating to the furthest unknown spaces detected by SLAM, until the map is fully explored and closed.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Dynamic Exploration Algorithm**: 
  The robot identifies the furthest unknown area in the SLAM-generated map and navigates to it sequentially.
- **Parameter Optimization**: 
  Tuned parameters for smooth exploration, even in narrow pathways.
- **Efficient Coverage**: 
  Ensures that all unknown spaces are mapped with minimal redundancy.
